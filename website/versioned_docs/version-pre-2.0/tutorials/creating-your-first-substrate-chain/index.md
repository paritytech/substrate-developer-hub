In this tutorial, you will learn to create a custom ["Proof Of
Existence"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence) blockchain using the Substrate
blockchain development framework.

This tutorial is aimed at someone who has never touched Substrate before, and wants to get a
**basic** and **quick** understanding of what Substrate is all about. We will not be going into
depth about the intricacies of developing on Substrate, but will hopefully satisfy your curiosity so
that you will continue this journey.

This tutorial should take you about **1 hour** to complete. We will be using the [Rust programming
language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), but you do not need to
know these to be able to complete this guide. We will provide you with working code snippets and
explain what all the code does at a high level.

We only expect that:

* You are generally familiar with software development and using the terminal.
* You are generally familiar with blockchains and smart contract platforms.
* You are open to learning about the bleeding edge of blockchain development.

It is important to emphasize again that Substrate is truly a bleeding edge framework. It is moving
fast, and as a result, may sometimes break or cause issues. If you run into an issue on this
tutorial, **we are here to help!**

You can [create a new
issue](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-developer-hub.github.io/issues/new) or
contact us directly on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!HzySYSaIhtyWrwiwEV:matrix.org).

## What you will be doing

Before we even get started, let's layout what we are going to do over the course of this tutorial.
We will:

1. Set up your computer to be able to develop on Substrate.
2. Use a template project to start running Substrate right away.
3. Modify this template project to add our own custom logic.
4. Modify a front-end template to interact with your brand new blockchain.

Sound reasonable? Good, then let's begin!
