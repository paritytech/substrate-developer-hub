In this section we will teach you about the Substrate blockchain development framework.

## Background on Blockchains

Blockchain development is hard.

Blockchain networks are composed of individual **nodes** that are connected together on a
peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Nodes are the individual computers on a network running the blockchain
software that makes everything work.

To function, a blockchain node needs:

* A Database
* P2P Networking
* A Consensus Engine
* Transaction Handling
* A State Transition Function
* and more...

These technologies span a huge breadth of computer science, and thus usually require expert teams to
develop. As a result, most blockchain projects are _not_ developed from the ground up. Instead,
these projects are forked from already existing blockchain repositories. For instance:

* The Bitcoin repository was forked to create: Litecoin, ZCash, Namecoin, Bitcoin Cash, etc...
* The Ethereum repository was forked to create: Quorem, POA Network, KodakCoin, Musicoin, etc...

Building blockchains in this way has serious limitations as these existing platform were not
designed to be modified.

## Substrate

Substrate is an **open source**, **modular**, and **extensible** framework for building blockchains.

Substrate has been designed from the ground up to provide a flexible framework for innovators to
design and build their next blockchain network. It provides all the core components you need to
build a customized blockchain node.

### Substrate Node Template

We provide an out-of-the-box working Substrate node in the form of the `substrate-node-template`,
which should be compiling as you read this. Without making any changes, you and your friends could
share this node template and create a working blockchain network with a cryptocurrency and
everything!

We will teach you how to use this node in "developer" mode, which allows you to run a network with a
single node, and have some pre-configured user accounts with funds.

### Substrate Pallet Template

The Substrate framework (FRAME) puts an emphasis on making it easy to design custom block execution
logic, a.k.a. the state transition function of the blockchain. We call this part of Substrate the
**runtime**.

The Substrate runtime is composed of FRAME pallets. You can think of these pallets as individual
pieces of logic which define what your blockchain can do! Substrate provides you with a number of
pre-built pallets built with the FRAME framework.

![Runtime Composition](assets/runtime.png)

For example, FRAME includes a
[Balances](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/pallet_balances/index.html) pallet that controls
the underlying currency of your blockchain by managing the _balance_ of all the accounts in your
system. 

If you want to add smart contract functionality to your blockchain, you simply need to include the
[Contracts](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/pallet_contracts/index.html) pallet.

Even things like on-chain governance can be added to your blockchain by including pallets like
[Democracy](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/pallet_democracy/index.html),
[Elections](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/pallet_elections/index.html), and
[Collective](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/pallet_collective/index.html).

The goal of this tutorial is to teach you how to create your own Substrate pallet which will be
included in your custom blockchain! The `substrate-node-template` comes with a template pallet that
we will build your custom logic on top of.

## Proof Of Existence Chain

The custom logic we will add to your Substrate runtime is a Proof of Existence pallet. From
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence): 

> Proof of Existence is an online service that verifies the existence of computer files as of a
> specific time via timestamped transactions in the bitcoin blockchain.

Rather than uploading the entire file to the blockchain to "prove its existence", users submit a
[hash of the file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_verification), known as a file digest or
checksum. These digests are powerful because huge files can be uniquely represented by a small hash
value, which is efficient for storing on the blockchain. Any user with the original file can prove
that this file matches the one on the blockchain by simply recomputing the hash of the file and
compare it with the hash stored on chain.

![File Hash](assets/file-hash.png)

To add to this, blockchain systems also provide a robust account system. So when a file digest is
stored on the blockchain, we can also record which user uploaded that digest. This allows that user
to later prove that they were the original person to claim the file.

Our Proof of Existence pallet will expose two callable functions:

* `create_claim` - allows a user to claim the existence of a file by uploading a file digest.

* `revoke_claim` - allows the current owner of a claim to revoke their ownership.

We will only need to store information about the proofs that have been claimed, and who made those
claims.

Sounds simple enough?

If your node is finished compiling, you are ready to move to the next section where we will interact
with your Substrate node template!
