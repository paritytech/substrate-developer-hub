The genesis configuration is used to initialize the state of storage items in the Substrate runtime at the first block.

## Declaring Configurable Storage Items

In Substrate, a storage item can be initialized in the genesis configuration. To enable this, you add the `config()` parameter to the storage item declaration.

For example, in the SRML sudo module (`srml-sudo`), the storage item `Key` is declared with a `config()` parameter.

```rust
decl_storage! {
    trait Store for Module<T: Trait> as Sudo {
        Key get(key) config(): T::AccountId;
    }
}
```

## The _Module_ GenesisConfig Type

When the `decl_storage!` macro expands, it generates the `GenesisConfig` type, which includes a reference to each storage item declared with the `config()` parameter.

For example, for the SRML sudo module (`srml-sudo`), the following `GenesisConfig` type is generated.

```rust
pub struct GenesisConfig<T: Trait> {
    pub key: T::AccountId,
}
```

Each module that supports a genesis configuration will also have its `GenesisConfig` type aliased as `<ModuleName>Config` as part of the `construct_runtime!` macro expansion:

```rust
pub type SudoConfig = sudo::GenesisConfig<Runtime>;
```

## The _Outer_ GenesisConfig Struct

Once a storage item is declared with a genesis configuration, its value needs to be set. We do this through an _outer_ `GenesisConfig` type, which is generated by the `construct_runtime!` macro:

```rust
pub struct GenesisConfig {
    pub system: Option<SystemConfig>,
    pub timestamp: Option<TimestampConfig>,
    pub consensus: Option<ConsensusConfig>,
    pub indices: Option<IndicesConfig>,
    pub balances: Option<BalancesConfig>,
    pub sudo: Option<SudoConfig>,
}
```

This outer type includes references to each of the modules' `GenesisConfig` types.

## Setting the Genesis Configuration Values

Now that we have established the module and outer `GenesisConfig` types, we need to set their values.

You can find an example of this in Substrate's `node-template` within the `chain_spec.rs` file. For the SRML sudo module (`srml-sudo`), the following code snippet shows the genesis configuration of the storage item `Key`.

```rust
fn testnet_genesis(root_key: AccountId, ...) -> GenesisConfig {
    GenesisConfig {
        sudo: Some(SudoConfig 
        {
            key: root_key,
        }),
        ...
    }
}
```

When you start your node, the _outer_ `GenesisConfig` that you specified will be used to set the initial values into storage. At that point, you can access and use those values just like you would any other runtime storage item.

> **Note:** The `GenesisConfig` type is not available for the WASM runtime environment, but only available for the native environment. The configurable storage items are treated as pre-initialized by the WASM environment.

## Exposing the GenesisConfig Type

The `GenesisConfig` type is not directly exposed through the Substrate metadata endpoint. Instead, the `GenesisConfig` is used to set an initial value for `Storage` items, so you can find the impact of this configuration by querying the storage.
