Welcome to the Substrate Developer Hub.

As a next generation blockchain framework, Substrate has three distinct features:

* A dynamic, self-defining state-transition function.
* Light-client functionality from day one.
* A progressive consensus algorithm with fast block production and adaptive, definite finality.

## Reference Documentation

You might be looking for the reference documentation for Substrate's Rust codebase. You can find those crate docs in our [Reference Documentation](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs).

## Guided User Stories

If you are not sure where you should get started, check out our **Guided User Stories** which are designed to take you down the quickest path to get you started with Substrate.

## Tutorials

We have created many end-to-end tutorials to help you learn about the different parts of Substrate. Go to the [Tutorials](/tutorials/) page and start building today!

## Products

Within the Substrate ecosystem, you can build blockchains, smart contracts, and even user interfaces! Here is a quick overview of the different products that comprise this space:

* [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate): A next generation blockchain development framework built using WebAssembly, Libp2p, and GRANDPA consensus.
* [ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink): A Rust-based eDSL for building WebAssembly smart contracts compatible with Substrate's Contracts module.
* [Polkadot-JS/API](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api): Promise and RxJS APIs for interacting with Substrate-based chains via RPC calls.
* [Polkadot-JS/Apps](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps): A basic UI for interacting with all features of a Substrate node. Powered by Polkadot-JS/API.
* [oo7-substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/oo7/tree/master/packages/oo7-substrate): A ReactJS based API for interacting with Substrate-based chains via RPC Calls. Also known as the "Bonds" library.
* [Substrate UI](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-ui): A basic ReactJS-based UI built for quickly building new interfaces for Substrate chains. Powered by oo7-substrate.
