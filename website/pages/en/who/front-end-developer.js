          <p>
            Substrate exposes an number of endpoints over JSON-RPC. To be able to interact with these endpoints, your data needs to be decoded and encoded following a standardized codec.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make your life easier, we provide you with a reactive Javascript API that wraps all RPC methods exposed
            by a Polkadot or Substrate client and handles all the decoding and encoding for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the steps below, you'll be fit to write your own frontend applications for Substrate and Polkadot. 
            Please join our community on Riot if you have any questions or ask them tagged with <code>[substrate]</code> on StackOverflow.

          <p>
            Before writing your own code, you should get familiar with what Substrate has to offer. The Polkadot-JS Apps are a set of applications that reflect Substrates standard runtime modules. They let you explore all built-in features, provide lot's of additional information and even let you interact with your custom runtime modules.
          </p>
          <p>
            You don't even need to install anything, just start with the Parity hosted Polkadot and Substrate nodes!

            If you're interested in having a look at an alternate Javascript API, start exploring the
            `oo7-bonds` repository.
            "Bonds" is an alternative JSON-RPC wrapper around Substrate and Polkadot. It's written in
            plain Javascript and comes with it's own implementation of the SCALE Codec.
            The "Bonds" API is best used together with the "Substrate UI", which is a React based
            single page application.
