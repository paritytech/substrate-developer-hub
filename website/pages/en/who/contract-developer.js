            . <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/ink">ink!</a> is a Rust
            based eDSL for writing smart contracts on this platform. The
            resources below will help you get up to speed on how to use
            Substrate and ink! in the context of writing smart contracts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both platforms are still in rapid development and may run into
            braking changes in the near future. So join our community on riot
            and ask questions using the <code>[ink]</code> tag on StackOverflow

          <p>
            Let's get off the ground running by deploying your first contract to
            a local Substrate chain. No development experience is needed here,
            we will just have you set up Substrate and the ink! build
            environment so that you can compile and deploy a simple "flipper"
            contract. You will even use the Polkadot Apps to interact with your
            contract in real time!

          <p>
            Next we will walk you through the basics of contract development on
            ink!. For this we will assume you have some background in Solidity,
            the language used for building smart contracts on Ethereum.

            Now that you have gotten the basics down, you can jump into our end
            to end workshop where we will teach you in detail how to build more
            complicated contracts like an incrementer and ultimately an ERC20
            token.

            Remember that ink! is still a rapidly developing platform, so take
            advantage of the community resources linked at the beginning of your
            journey and share your experiences!
