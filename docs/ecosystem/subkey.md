title: "The `subkey` Tool"
---
Subkey is a key-generation utility that is developed alongside substrate. Its main features are generating Ed25519 and Sr25519 key pairs, encoding SS58 addresses, and restoring keys from mnemonics and raw seeds. This guide serves as an introduction and tour of the tool. Once you are familiar with `subkey`, it will be more time-efficient to refresh your memory by looking at `subkey help` than by re-reading this intro.

## Building the Subkey Binary

### One-line Install
The Subkey binary, `subkey`, is also installed along with the [Substrate installation](getting-started/installing-substrate.md). If you want to play with just subkey (and not Substrate), you can compile and install it with this one-line command.
```bash
cargo install --force --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate subkey
```

### Compiling with Cargo
If you already have the [Substrate repository](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) cloned, you can build it with
```bash
cargo build -p subkey
```

## Generating Your First Key
Generate an Sr25519 key by running:
```bash
satoshi@jambox$ subkey generate

  Public key (hex): 0xec57cf6230ce7e675123d056eda9ab331aa6fb3ba422c5fd194721ddc6b69a14
  Address (SS58): 5HQbF3hCugq71XdCk43FcxVqduhu7JojGiBfzD8iEFW22kiy
```

Subkey has just consumed some entropy and generated a cryptographic Sr25519 key pair. The output tells us a few properties of our key.

- Phrase (aka **Mnemonic Phrase**) - A series of English words that encodes the seed in a more human-friendly way.
- Seed (aka **Private Key / Raw Seed**) - The minimum necessary information to restore the key pair. All other information is calculated from the seed.
- **Public Key** - The public half of the cryptographic key pair in hexadecimal.
- Address (aka **Public Address**) - An SS58-encoded address based on the public key.

(See [this issue](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/2669#issuecomment-495702589) for why `subkey` still outputs the old jargon for now.)

## Inspecting keys
The inspect command recalculates a key pair's public key and public address given its seed. This shows that it is sufficient to back up the seed alone.
```bash
satoshi@jambox$ subkey inspect 0xe35fdbf9b9ddf8e54e0c1d49fe50561a5a7fd31728450f7a9f8663820c09401e

Secret Key URI `0xe35fdbf9b9ddf8e54e0c1d49fe50561a5a7fd31728450f7a9f8663820c09401e` is account:
  Public key (hex): 0xec57cf6230ce7e675123d056eda9ab331aa6fb3ba422c5fd194721ddc6b69a14
  Address (SS58): 5HQbF3hCugq71XdCk43FcxVqduhu7JojGiBfzD8iEFW22kiy
```

You can also inspect the key by its mnemonic phrase. Mind the quotes.
```bash
satoshi@jambox$ subkey inspect "mosquito sketch face supreme side tourist monkey damp idea warm luggage better"

Secret Key URI `mosquito sketch face supreme side tourist monkey damp idea warm luggage better` is account:
  Public key (hex): 0xec57cf6230ce7e675123d056eda9ab331aa6fb3ba422c5fd194721ddc6b69a14
  Address (SS58): 5HQbF3hCugq71XdCk43FcxVqduhu7JojGiBfzD8iEFW22kiy
```

Mnemonic phrases were first introduced in Bitcoin (see [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)) and make it much easier to manually write down your key. They also allow cool things like "memorizing" your life savings.

## Ed25519 keys
So far we've been using Sr25519 keys. Substrate uses those keys in most places, which is why they are the default for `subkey`. Ed25519 keys may be generated by providing the `-e` or `--ed25519` flag (see `subkey help`):

```bash
satoshi@jambox:~$ subkey -e generate
Phrase `kick raw cram palm fiction term two salt allow document hidden mix` is account:
  Seed: 0x8167e5997afeed9886bc88ebb94d8905b330540bfa4624dcc6d0e983171e67ed
  Public key (hex): 0x61319aa2d62a87bb1adbe18ab436bc60ab949dea07a1b7859deb13bdfbb85f53
  Address (SS58): 5EG9Ej4JPcb1YHn8R2ai5p7EApwTyXMVYiCzueY7yRLwGEAf
```

## Password Protected keys
You can put a password on a key by using the `--password` option (in the example below the password is "pass" followed by the `generate` subcommand, see `subkey help`). The output looks exactly the same as before.
```bash
satoshi@jambox:~$ subkey --password pass generate

Phrase `certain notable bacon broken reflect fragile accuse march bamboo isolate call gate` is account:
  Seed: 0xf4e6c7f224705dc0c803f29a7f721238a23489f4bedd70e9faa839e0a1d1a392
  Public key (hex): 0x229b59387b74aa45eeda235b461b655b84f9694a3e280775d5438d64d477673a
  Address (SS58): 5Cr5dgyZD16Uc6rDNHs494wNCEwD4wfjQvUGG6wdma9EMib8
```

Indeed we can still restore the key with nothing but its seed. This shows that even if the key is generated with a password, the seed alone _still_ holds all the information about the key.
```bash
satoshi@jambox:~$ subkey inspect 0xf4e6c7f224705dc0c803f29a7f721238a23489f4bedd70e9faa839e0a1d1a392

Secret Key URI `0xf4e6c7f224705dc0c803f29a7f721238a23489f4bedd70e9faa839e0a1d1a392` is account:
  Public key (hex): 0x229b59387b74aa45eeda235b461b655b84f9694a3e280775d5438d64d477673a
  Address (SS58): 5Cr5dgyZD16Uc6rDNHs494wNCEwD4wfjQvUGG6wdma9EMib8
```

But notice what happens when we try to restore the key from the mnemonic phrase. Although the output looks _similar_ it is _not_ identical. We are restoring a completely different key pair. Notice the public key and address don't match.
```bash
satoshi@jambox$ subkey inspect "certain notable bacon broken reflect fragile accuse march bamboo isolate call gate"

Secret Key URI `certain notable bacon broken reflect fragile accuse march bamboo isolate call gate` is account:
  Public key (hex): 0x08898f67df39ba5a5a9f6fd1ed1273cabce440851b537a07fad152f85649ce66
  Address (SS58): 5CFu6zbvJ9Z49w4RXM3FqrkmseSi5aFAUVbvW6jRnZzsZjYG
```

This is because the password we supplied when generating the key-pair is necessary to restore the key from the mnemonic phrase.
```bash
satoshi@jambox$ subkey -p pass inspect "certain notable bacon broken reflect fragile accuse march bamboo isolate call gate"

Secret Key URI `certain notable bacon broken reflect fragile accuse march bamboo isolate call gate` is account:
  Public key (hex): 0x229b59387b74aa45eeda235b461b655b84f9694a3e280775d5438d64d477673a
  Address (SS58): 5Cr5dgyZD16Uc6rDNHs494wNCEwD4wfjQvUGG6wdma9EMib8
```

## Well-known keys
If you've worked with Substrate previously, you likely encountered the ubiquitous accounts for Alice, Bob, and their friends. These keys are not at all private, but are useful for playing with Substrate without always generating new key pairs. You can inspect these "well-known" keys with `subkey`.

```bash
satoshi@jambox$ subkey inspect //Alice

Secret Key URI `//Alice` is account:
  Public key (hex): 0xd43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd6822c8558854ccde39a5684e7a56da27d
  Address (SS58): 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY
```

There is nothing special about the name Alice. You can do the same trick with your own name. But remember that keys like this are _not_ secure, and are only useful for experimenting.
```bash
satoshi@jambox$ subkey inspect //Joshy

Secret Key URI `//Joshy` is account:
  Public key (hex): 0x006f5081d495811a16724b317fcd70b8e42c9317da2ba1f5c36756a41fadec67
  Address (SS58): 5C5GvaAWfruRLnCJYgJrut1JovGeMMXV2VzXeiua7f691J9R
```

## Derivation Paths
Commonly one will need multiple keys to work together. For example you may need to use an Sr25519 key along with an Ed25519 key. When the keys are intended to be used together, it is convenient to only remember a single mnemonic phrase. Luckily `subkey` provides derivation paths for that.

### Hard Paths
`subkey` supports both hard and soft derivation paths. Let's start by looking at hard paths, and then explain the difference when we get to soft paths.

```bash
satoshi@jambox$ subkey inspect "certain notable bacon broken reflect fragile accuse march bamboo isolate call gate"//DerivationPath

Secret Key URI `certain notable bacon broken reflect fragile accuse march bamboo isolate call gate//DerivationPath` is account:
  Public key (hex): 0x62036ec7a705c7764efdd84258e2099d528753333d206e69ab038354cca59375
  Address (SS58): 5EHDZzNkfijCrJFk94HuG8s3F9Jdz539vnJaNj6Uu22bomnB
```

Now we can derive a second key from the same mnemonic. It can even be an Ed25519 key.
```bash
satoshi@jambox$ subkey -e inspect "certain notable bacon broken reflect fragile accuse march bamboo isolate call gate"//OtherPath

Secret Key URI `certain notable bacon broken reflect fragile accuse march bamboo isolate call gate//OtherPath` is account:
  Seed: 0x48f229d1588c1b0975f76d63b7a1235aad96060402c374b7d57680cd65699b1c
  Public key (hex): 0xaa75292d215127795416b4546949fa2b46f11a211260616ceb085dec7f35b6fa
  Address (SS58): 5FvCoSqcEpmTJ8ucrmMv2FpK7TcmZAx6uhX26UhBfJW4CnLg
```

### Soft Paths
Soft paths are mostly similar, but have some differences.

For one, they are written with a single slash instead of double.
```bash
satoshi@jambox$ subkey inspect "certain notable bacon broken reflect fragile accuse march bamboo isolate call gate"/SoftPath

Secret Key URI `certain notable bacon broken reflect fragile accuse march bamboo isolate call gate/SoftPath` is account:
  Public key (hex): 0x54be520bcb4ae8ad032e4abd075c9ebf68e5baf11154e82cacd8d5f438d73066
  Address (SS58): 5DypR7GB9fvsVuFUqPKowbEjecnF62FX7wRrftGsRrW4LaxE
```

Another difference is that soft paths don't work with Ed25519 keys

```bash
# No output is expected
satoshi@jambox$ subkey -e inspect "certain notable bacon broken reflect fragile accuse march bamboo isolate call gate"/SoftPath
```

But the biggest difference is that soft paths allow you to calculate the derived public keys from just the original _public_ address and the path. They don't require knowing any private information to derive.

```bash
# Public address taken from when we first generated this key
satoshi@jambox subkey inspect 5CFu6zbvJ9Z49w4RXM3FqrkmseSi5aFAUVbvW6jRnZzsZjYG/SoftPath
Public Key URI `5CFu6zbvJ9Z49w4RXM3FqrkmseSi5aFAUVbvW6jRnZzsZjYG/SoftPath` is account:
  Public key (hex): 0x54be520bcb4ae8ad032e4abd075c9ebf68e5baf11154e82cacd8d5f438d73066
  Address (SS58): 5DypR7GB9fvsVuFUqPKowbEjecnF62FX7wRrftGsRrW4LaxE
```

Try to restore a key derived from a hard path using only public information to confirm for yourself that it is not possible.

## More `subkey` to Explore
`subkey` is getting more robust all the time. Recently it has added features to sign messages, verify signatures over messages, and create signed token transfer transactions. Learn more by running `subkey help`.

Key-pairs can also be generated in the [PolkadotJS Apps UI](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps). Try creating keys with the UI and restoring them with `subkey` or vice versa.
