Welcome to the Substrate Developer Hub. 

As a next generation blockchain framework, Substrate is designed to help majority of developers build decentralized application to improve their business value. 

Within Substrate ecosystem, developers can build decentralized application in two forms, one is to build your own business specific blockchain, the other is to run your business with Smart Contract. As you walk through the documents, you will learn more details.

## Reference documents

You might be looking for the reference documentation for Substrate's Rust codebase. You can find those crate docs in our [Reference Documentation](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs).

## Tutorials

We have provided many end to end tutorials to help you learn about the different parts of Substrate. Go to [Tutorials](/tutorials/) page, pick the one you are most interested in and get your hands dirty!

## Guided User Stories

## Products

Within the Substrate ecosystem, you can build blockchains, smart contracts, and even user interfaces! Here is a quick overview of the different products which comprise this space:

* [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate): A next generation blockchain development framework built using WebAssembly, Libp2p and GRANDPA Consensus.
* [ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink): A Rust based eDSL for building WebAssembly based smart contracts compatible with Substrate's Contract module.
* [Polkadot-JS/API](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api): Promise and RxJS APIs for interacting with Substrate-based chains via RPC calls.
* [Polkadot-JS/Apps](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps): A basic UI for interacting with all features of a Substrate node. Powered by Polkadot-JS/API.
* [oo7-substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/oo7/tree/master/packages/oo7-substrate): A ReactJS based API for interacting with Substrate-based chains via RPC Calls.
* [Substrate UI](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-ui): A basic ReactJS based UI built for quickly building new interfaces for Substrate chains. Powered by oo7-substrate.

## Join the Community

Substrate has a rapidly growing, friendly, and technical community. Ask questions and work with others who are building in the space. Check out all the community resources available to you via our [Community page](/community/).
