Welcome to the Substrate Developer Hub. 

As a next generation blockchain framework, Substrate has three distinct features:

* A dynamic, self-defining state-transition function.
* Light-client functionality from day one.
* A progressive consensus algorithm with fast block production and adaptive, definite finality.

## Reference Documentation

You might be looking for the reference documentation for Substrate's Rust codebase. You can find those crate docs in our [Reference Documentation](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs).

## Guided User Stories

If you are not sure where you should get started, check out our **Guided User Stories** which are designed to take you down the quickest path to get you started with Substrate.

## Tutorials

We have created many end-to-end tutorials to help you learn about the different parts of Substrate. Go to the [Tutorials](/tutorials/) page and start building today!

## Products

Within the Substrate ecosystem, you can build blockchains, smart contracts, and even user interfaces! Here is a quick overview of the different products that comprise this space:

* [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate): A next generation blockchain development framework built using WebAssembly, Libp2p, and GRANDPA consensus.
	* [Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template): A minimal blockchain node, ready to power your next Substrate project!
	* [Substrate Module Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-module-template): A template for building independent runtime modules which can easily be shared with others.
* [ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink): A Rust-based eDSL for building WebAssembly smart contracts compatible with Substrate's Contracts module.
* [Polkadot-JS/API](https://polkadot.js.org/api/start/): Promise and RxJS APIs for interacting with Substrate-based chains via RPC calls.
	* [Polkadot-JS/Apps](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps): A basic UI for interacting with all features of a Substrate node. Powered by Polkadot-JS/API.
	* [Substrate Front-End Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template): A Polkadot.js API + React based template for building Substrate front ends.
