title: Set Up Your Computer
---

Normally, we would teach you more about the Substrate blockchain development framework, however,
setting up your computer for Substrate development can take a while.

To optimize your time, we will have you start the setup process. While things are compiling, you can
continue to the next section to learn more about Substrate and what we are building.

## Prerequisites

You will probably need to do some set-up to prepare your computer for Substrate development.

### Substrate Development

Refer to the [official Installation guide](../../knowledgebase/getting-started/). Since this
tutorial uses the Node Template, which includes configuration files and scripts for initializing and
interacting with it, it's not necessary to complete all the steps from the Installation guide. After
`rustup` has been installed and configured, and you've configured the Rust toolchain to default to
the latest stable version you can return to these steps.

## Compiling Substrate

Once the prerequisites are installed, you can use Git to clone the Substrate Developer Hub Node
Template, which serves as a good starting point for building on Substrate.

1. Clone the Node Template (version `v2.0.0`).

    ```bash
    git clone -b v2.0.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template
    ```

2. Initialize your WebAssembly build environment

    ```bash
    make init
    ```

3. Compile the Node Template

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

The time required for the compilation step depends on the hardware you're using. Don't wait before
moving on.

## Install the Front-End Template

This tutorial uses a ReactJS front-end template to allow you to interact with the Substrate-based
blockchain node that you should have started compiling in the previous step. You can use this same
front-end template to create UIs for your own projects in the future.

To use the front-end template, you need [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), which itself requires
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you don't have these tools, you may install them from these
instructions:

- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

Now you can proceed to set up the front-end template with these commands.

```bash
# Clone the code from github
git clone -b v2.0.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template

# Install the dependencies
cd substrate-front-end-template
yarn install
```
