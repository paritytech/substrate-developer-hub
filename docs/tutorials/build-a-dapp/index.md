title: Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn to create a custom
["Proof of Existence"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence) dApp using the Substrate
blockchain development framework and [FRAME](../../knowledgebase/runtime/frame) runtime libraries.

This tutorial should take you about **1 hour** to complete. We will be using the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), but you
do not need to know these to be able to complete this guide. We will provide you with working code
snippets and explain what all the code does at a high level.

We only expect that:

- You are generally familiar with software development, writing code, and running your code.
- You have completed the
  [Create Your First Substrate Chain Tutorial](../../tutorials/create-your-first-substrate-chain).
- You are open to learning about the bleeding edge of blockchain development.

If you run into an issue on this tutorial, **we are here to help!** You can
[ask a question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/substrate) and use the
`substrate` tag or contact us on

## What you will be doing

Before we even get started, let's lay out what we are going to do over the course of this tutorial.
We will:

1. Launch a Substrate blockchain based on a template project.
2. Modify this template project to add our own custom logic.
3. Modify a front-end template to interact with your brand new blockchain.

Sound reasonable? Good, then let's begin!
