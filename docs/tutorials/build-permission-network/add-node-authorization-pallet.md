title: Add node-authorization pallet

## About `node-authorization` pallet

The `node-authorization` pallet is a build-in pallet in Substrate FRAME, which manages 
a configurable set of nodes for a permissioned network. 
Each node is identified by a `PeerId` which is simply a wrapper on `Vec<u8>`.
Each `PeerId` is owned by an `AccountId` that claims it
(these are [associated in a map](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0/pallet_node_authorization/struct.Owners.html)).
With this pallet, you have two ways to authorize a node which wants to join the network:

1. Join the set of well known nodes between which the connections are allowed.
    Such effort usually needs to be approved by the governance in the system.
2. Ask for the connection from a node which is already a member of the network.
    Such node can either be a well known node or a normal one. 

A node associated with a `PeerId` must have **one and only one owner**.
The owner of a well known node is specified when adding it.
If it's a normal node, *any* user can claim a `PeerId` as its owner.
To protect against false claims, the maintainer of the node should claim it *before even starting the node*
(after getting the `PeerId` of course). 

The owner can then change the additional connections for his (or her) node.
To make it clear, you can't change the connections between well known nodes,
they are always allowed to connect with each other. 
Instead, you can manipulate the connection between a well know node 
and a normal node or between two normal nodes.

It uses [offchain worker](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/off-chain-workers)
to set authorized nodes in node-authorization pallet. Make sure to enable offchain worker with
the right CLI flag as offchain worker is diabled by default for non-authority nodes.
Your node can be lagged with the latest block, in this case you need to disable offchain worker
and manually set reachable reserved nodes to sync up with the network.

## Add the `node-authorization` pallet

If you already hace Node Template cloned, you can just create a 
**new branch and check it out** from the base template, 
otherwise, clone `v2.0.0` of the project:

```shell
# Fresh clone, if needed:
git clone -b v2.0.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template
# From the working directory, create a new branch and check it out
cd substrate-node-template
git branch perm-network
git checkout perm-network
```

You should be able to `check` the project (or `build`) without any error: 

```shell
cd substrate-node-template/
make init
make check
```

Now open the code with your favorite editor, can't wait to make some changes right?

In **runtime/Cargo.toml**, add the dependency of our pallet:

**`runtime/Cargo.toml`**

```TOML
[dependencies]
#--snip--
pallet-node-authorization = { default-features = false, version = '2.0.0' }

#--snip--
[features]
default = ['std']
std = [
    #--snip--
    pallet-node-authorization/std,
    #--snip--
]
```
Let's import and use our pallet in **runtime/src/lib.rs**. Firstly Import the dependency
with `use frame_system::EnsureRoot`, we need it to simulate the governance in our simple blockchain.
Then implement the configure trait of our pallet. More description on the trait can be found in 
its [reference doc](https://docs.rs/pallet-node-authorization/2.0.0/pallet_node_authorization/trait.Trait.html).

**`runtime/src/lib.rs`**

```rust

/* --snip-- */

use frame_system::EnsureRoot

/* --snip-- */

parameter_types! {
	pub const MaxWellKnownNodes: u32 = 8;
	pub const MaxPeerIdLength: u32 = 128;
}

impl pallet_node_authorization::Trait for Runtime {
	type Event = Event;
	type MaxWellKnownNodes = MaxWellKnownNodes;
	type MaxPeerIdLength = MaxPeerIdLength;
	type AddOrigin = EnsureRoot<AccountId>;
	type RemoveOrigin = EnsureRoot<AccountId>;
	type SwapOrigin = EnsureRoot<AccountId>;
	type ResetOrigin = EnsureRoot<AccountId>;
	type WeightInfo = ();
}

/* --snip-- */
```

Finally, we are ready to put our pallet in `construct_runtime` macro with following extra line of code:

**`runtime/src/lib.rs`**

```rust
construct_runtime!(
    pub enum Runtime where
        Block = Block,
        NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
        UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic
    {
        /* --snip-- */

        /*** Add This Line ***/
        NodeAuthorization: pallet_node_authorization::{Module, Call, Storage, Event<T>, Config<T>},

        /* --snip-- */

    }
);
```

## Add genesis storage for our pallet

`PeerId` is encoded in bs58 format, so we need a new library 
[bs58](https://docs.rs/bs58/0.3.1/bs58/) in **node/cargo.toml** to decode it to get its bytes.

**`node/cargo.toml`**

```TOML
[dependencies]
#--snip--
bs58 = "0.3.1"
#--snip--
```

Now we add a proper genesis storage in **node/src/chain_spec.rs**. Similarly, import the necessary dependencies:

**node/src/chain_spec.rs**

```rust
/* --snip-- */
use sp_core::OpaquePeerId; // A struct wraps Vec<u8>, represents as our `PeerId`.
use node_template_runtime::NodeAuthorizationConfig; // The genesis config that serves for our pallet.
/* --snip-- */
```

Adding our genesis config in the helper function `testnet_genesis`,

```rust
/// Configure initial storage state for FRAME modules.
fn testnet_genesis(
	wasm_binary: &[u8],
	initial_authorities: Vec<(AuraId, GrandpaId)>,
	root_key: AccountId,
	endowed_accounts: Vec<AccountId>,
	_enable_println: bool,
) -> GenesisConfig {

    /* --snip-- */

    /*** Add This Block Item ***/
    pallet_node_authorization: Some(NodeAuthorizationConfig {
    	nodes: vec![
    		(
    			OpaquePeerId(bs58::decode("12D3KooWBmAwcd4PJNJvfV89HwE48nwkRmAgo8Vy3uQEyNNHBox2").into_vec().unwrap()),
		    	endowed_accounts[0].clone()
    		),
    		(
	    		OpaquePeerId(bs58::decode("12D3KooWQYV9dGMFoRzNStwpXztXaBUjtPqi6aU76ZgUriHhKust").into_vec().unwrap()),
	    		endowed_accounts[1].clone()
	    	),
    	],
    }),
    
    /* --snip-- */

}
```

`NodeAuthorizationConfig` contains a property named `nodes`, which is vector of tuple.
The first element of the tuple is the `OpaquePeerId` and we use `bs58::decode` to convert
the `PeerId` in human readable format to bytes. The second element of the tuple is `AccountId`
and represents the owner of this node, here we are using one of the provided endowned accounts
for demonstration. To make it clear, the owner of the first node is Alice, and Bob owns the second node.

You may wondering where the `12D3KooWBmAwcd4PJNJvfV89HwE48nwkRmAgo8Vy3uQEyNNHBox2` comes from.
We can use [subkey](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey#generating-node-keys) to generate the above human readable `PeerId`.

```shell
subkey generate-node-key
```

> Note: `subkey` is a CLI tool that comes bundled with substrate, and you can install it natively too! 
>  - [Install Intructions](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey#installation)

The output of the command is like:

```shell
12D3KooWBmAwcd4PJNJvfV89HwE48nwkRmAgo8Vy3uQEyNNHBox2 // this is PeerId.
c12b6d18942f5ee8528c8e2baf4e147b5c5c18710926ea492d09cbd9f6c9f82a // This is node-key.
```

Now all the code changes are finished, we are ready to launch our permissoned network. Go get yourself some water!
