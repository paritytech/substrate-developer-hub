title: Introduction
---

In this tutorial, you will learn to create a custom ["Proof Of Existence"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_Existence) blockchain using the Substrate blockchain development framework.

This tutorial is aimed at someone who has never touched Substrate before, and wants to get a **basic** and **quick** understanding of what Substrate is all about. We will not be going too in depth about the intricacies of developing on Substrate, but will hopefully satisfy your curiosity so that you will continue this journey.

We predict that this tutorial will take you about **30 min to set up**, where you will not be actively doing anything, and about **1 hour of active participation** to complete. We will be using the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) throughout this tutorial, but you do not need to know it to be able to complete this guide. We will provide you with working code snippets and explain what each line does at a high level.

We only expect that:

* You are generally familiar with software development and using the terminal
* You are generally familiar with blockchains and smart contract platforms
* You are open to learning about the bleeding edge of blockchain development.

It is important to emphasize again that Substrate is truly a bleeding edge framework. It is moving fast, and as a result, may sometimes break or cause issues. If you run into an issue on this tutorial, **we are here to help!**

You can [create a new issue](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-developer-hub.github.io/issues/new) or contact us directly on [Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/!HzySYSaIhtyWrwiwEV:matrix.org).

## What you will be doing

Before we even get started, let's layout what we are going to do over the course of this tutorial. We will:

1. Set up your computer to be able to develop on Substrate.
2. Use a template project to start running Substrate right away.
3. Modify this template project to add our own custom logic.
4. Use a pre-built front-end to interact with your brand new blockchain.
5. Review our initial implementation and iterate on it to start putting you in the mindset of a real Substrate blockchain developer.

Sound reasonable? Good, then let's begin!
