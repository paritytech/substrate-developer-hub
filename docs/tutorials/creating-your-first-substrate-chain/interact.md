title: Interacting with Your Node
---

Now that your node has finished compiling, let's show you how everything works out of the box.

## Starting Your Node

Run the following commands to start your node:

```bash
cd substrate-node-template/
# Purge chain cleans up any old data from running a `dev` node in the past
# You will be prompted to type `y`
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev
# Run your actual node in "developer" mode
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

You should see something like this if your node is running successfully:

```bash
$ ./target/release/node-template --dev

```

If the number after `best:` is increasing, your blockchain is producing new blocks!

## Start the Front End

To interact with the local node we will use the Polkadot-js Apps user interface, often known as
"Apps" for short. Despite the name, Apps will work with any Substrate-based blockchain including ours, not just Polkadot.

In your web browser, navigate to [https://polkadot.js.org/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/settings?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9944).

On the `Settings` tab ensure that you are connected to a `Local Node`.

> Some browsers, notably Firefox, will not connect to a local node from an https website. An easy work around is to try another browser, like Chromium. Another option is to [host this interface locally](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps#development).

## Interact

Select the **Accounts** tab, you will see test accounts that you have access to. Some, like Alice
and Bob, already have funds!

You can try to transfer some funds from Alice to Charlie by clicking the "send" button.

![Balance Transfer](assets/tutorials/first-chain/apps-transfer.png)

If everything went successfully, you should see some popup notifications claiming "Extrinsic
Success", and of course Charlie's balance will increase.

## Next Steps

This is the end of your journey to launching your first blockchain with Substrate.

You have launched a working Substrate-based blockchain, with an underlying cryptocurrency, attached a user interface to that chain, and made token transfers among users. We hope you'll continue learning about Substrate.

Your next step may be:

* Decentralize your network with more nodes in the [Start a Private Network](tutorials/start-a-private-network/index.md) tutorial.
* Add custom functionality in the [Build a dApp](tutorials/build-a-dapp/index.md) tutorial.

If you experienced any issues with this tutorial or want to provide feedback, feel free to [open a

issue](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-developer-hub.github.io/issues/new) with
your thoughts.
