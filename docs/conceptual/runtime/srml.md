title: Substrate Runtime Module Library
---

The Substrate Runtime Module Library (SRML) is a collection of prebuilt runtime modules and support
libraries which simplify development of a Substrate runtime.

## Overview

The following diagram shows the architectural overview of the SRML and its support libraries:

### Runtime Modules

The Substrate runtime is composed of several smaller components called runtime modules. A runtime
module contains a set of types, storage items, and functions that define a set of features and
functionality for a runtime.

### System Module

The [System module](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/frame_system/index.html) provides low-level types, storage, and
functions for your blockchain. All other modules depend on the System module as the basis of your
Substrate runtime.

The System module defines all the core types for the Substrate runtime, such as:

* Origin
* Block Number
* Account Id
* Hash
* Header
* Version
* etc...

It also has a number of system critical storage items, such as:

* Account Nonce
* Block Hash
* Block Number
* Events
* etc...

Finally, it defines a number of low level functions which can access your blockchain storage, verify
the origin of an extrinsic, and more.

### Executive Module

The [Executive module](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/pallet_executive/index.html) acts as the orchestration layer
for the runtime. It dispatches incoming extrinsic calls to the respective modules in the runtime.

### Support Library

The [SRML support library](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/master/frame_support/index.html) is a collection of Rust macros,
types, traits, and functions that simplify the development of Substrate runtime modules.

The support macros expand at compile time to generate code which is used by the runtime and reduce
boilerplate code for the most common components of a module.

### Runtime

The runtime library brings together all these components and modules. It defines which modules are
included with your runtime and configures them to work together to compose your final runtime. When
calls are made to your runtime, it uses the Executive module to dispatch those calls to the
individual runtime modules.

## SRML Modules

The SRML contains a set of prebuilt runtime modules that can be used in your Substrate chain.

### Assets

The Assets module is a simple, secure module for dealing with fungible assets.
