title: ink! F.A.Q.
---

This page will answer a number of common questions you may have when starting to build smart
contracts for Substrate.

## ink! F.A.Q.

### What is the difference between memory and storage?

In ink! we refer `memory` to being the computer memory that is commonly known to programmers while
with `storage` we refer to the contract instance's memory. The `storage` is backed up by the runtime
in a data base. Accesses to it are considered to be slow.

#### Example

While a `storage::Vec<T>` stores every of its elements in a different cell in the contract storage,
a `storage::Value<memory::Vec<T>>` would store all elements (and a length info) in a single cell.
Smart contract writers can use this to optimize for certain use cases. Using a
`storage::Value<memory::Vec<T>>` could probably be more efficient for a small amount of elements in
the `memory::Vec<T>`. We advise to use the more general `storage::Vec` for storing information on
the contract instance.

### How do I run tests?

When building a smart contract with ink, you can define a set of tests.

For example, in the minimal
[flipper contract](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/blob/master/examples/flipper/lib.rs),
you can find a small test at the bottom of the contract.

To run this test, type the following command:

```bash
cargo +nightly test
```

## Contracts Module

### How do I add the Contracts module to my custom chain?

You can follow
[our guide here](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/add-a-pallet-to-your-runtime/) for
instructions to add the Contracts pallet and other FRAME pallets to your blockchain runtime.
